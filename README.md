## **Ureter Interpolation** 
this code is to create new image by interpolate two image.
I made this code to make Ureter dataset


## **Why Interpolation?**
Research is underway to find ureter in CT images without contrast agents.
Dataset was provided by Hanyang University Seoul Hospital, and in the CT image, only one slice out of five was provided
I made the code to find the ureter for the remaining four slices.
